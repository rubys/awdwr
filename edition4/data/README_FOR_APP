= The Depot Online Store

This application implements an online store, with a catalog, cart, and orders.

It is divided into two main sections:

* The buyer's side of the application manages the catalog, cart,
  and checkout. It is implementation spans in four models and associated
  controllers and views: Cart, LineItem, Order, and Product.  Additionally,
  there is a StoreController for the store front itself, and a
  SessionsController to manage sessions.

* Only administrators can access stuff in the seller's side
  (product maintenance and order fulfillment).  This is implemented by the
  SessionsController, is enforced by the ApplicationController#authorize
  method, and assisted by the Users and Carts resources.

This code was produced as an example for the book {Agile Web Development with
Rails}[https://pragprog.com/titles/rails4]. It should not be 
run as a real online store.
